FEATURE IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS

Top 10 Most Important Features (Ridge Regression):
1. AvgOrderValue: +20.14 (customer spending patterns)
2. AvgProductPrice: +14.17 (product pricing level)
3. UnitPrice: -10.02 (individual item price)
4. Quantity: +2.62 (number of items)
5. ProductPopularity: +2.61 (customer reach)
6. ProductDiversity: +1.66 (customer variety)
7. AvgProductQuantity: -1.54 (typical order size)
8. CustomerEngagement: -0.98 (loyalty metric)
9. Month: +0.64 (seasonal effects)
10. OrderCount: -0.42 (purchase frequency)

Lasso Feature Selection Results:
Selected 4 out of 19 original features:
1. AvgOrderValue: +19.73
2. AvgProductPrice: +3.67
3. ProductPopularity: +1.66
4. Quantity: +0.56


Model Performance:
Linear Regression achieved best performance with 55.4% variance explained
Average prediction error of £19.57 is reasonable for transaction values ranging £0-£202
Lasso regression identified 4 core predictive features, simplifying the model

Feature Insights:
AvgOrderValue is the strongest predictor (coefficient +20.14)
Product pricing (AvgProductPrice) has significant positive impact
UnitPrice shows negative coefficient, suggesting bulk discount effects
Quantity purchased directly increases transaction value

Business Interpretation:
Customer spending patterns (AvgOrderValue) are highly predictive
Product pricing strategy significantly influences transaction values
Popular products command higher transaction amounts
Seasonal effects (Month) show measurable impact on sales

BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS

Revenue Forecasting:
Deploy Linear Regression model for monthly/quarterly revenue predictions
Expected accuracy of ±£19.57 suitable for aggregate planning
Model explains 55.4% of transaction variance, capturing major patterns

Customer Strategy:
Target customers with high AvgOrderValue for marketing campaigns
Focus inventory on products with high ProductPopularity scores
Develop pricing strategies based on AvgProductPrice relationships

Operational Improvements:
Monitor seasonal patterns identified in Month feature
Optimize product mix based on ProductDiversity insights
Use Quantity patterns for inventory forecasting

Model Deployment:
Retrain model monthly with new transaction data
Monitor prediction accuracy against actual transaction values
Consider A/B testing for pricing optimization based on predictions

CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS

Challenge 1: Large Dataset Processing
Issue: 397,884 records requiring efficient processing
Solution: Implemented streamlined feature engineering pipeline
Result: Successfully processed dataset with comprehensive feature creation

Challenge 2: Feature Selection Complexity
Issue: 19 engineered features with potential multicollinearity
Solution: Applied both Ridge (handles correlation) and Lasso (feature selection)
